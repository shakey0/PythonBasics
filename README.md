# The Very Basics of Python

## Introduction

This directory houses my earliest coding exercises and CLI games from the first three weeks of the Makers Academy bootcamp. At this juncture in my coding odyssey, I had yet to delve into Classes or Object Oriented Programming. So, if I were to revisit these tasks today, I'd likely infuse them with OOP principles. A significant portion of these tasks stem from Angela Yu's '100 Days of Code' course on Udemy. Others are inspired by Codewars, while a few showcase my own initial explorations. Beyond simply following along, I've added personal tweaks to many of the CLI games from Angela's course. I believe in remixing as a profound means to comprehend the code and truly grasp its essence.
